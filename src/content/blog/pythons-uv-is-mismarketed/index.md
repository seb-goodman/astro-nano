I'm a big fan of the Python package manager [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). I'll shudder using the word, but it is unironically a 'game-changer' (assuming it stays free and open source).

My appreciation for uv is probably why I've been so confused lately by how few Python developers have even come across it. Of those who have at least heard of uv, few are tempted to try it. I see this at work, but it's also borne out in conversations over social media.

Exhibit A

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hate python<br>I hate python3<br>I hate pip3<br>I hate pip<br>I hate venv<br><br>Why can&#39;t they just come up with a normal version and package manager for god&#39;s sake. This is ridiculous.</p>&mdash; Async (@0xAsync) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xAsync/status/1766962418171670661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Exhibit B

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve never had a python experience which didn&#39;t start with fighting the package manager and dependencies for the first few hours</p>&mdash; AJ Stuyvenberg (@astuyve) <a href="https://twitter.com/astuyve/status/1821575077655146751?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Perhaps part of the reason for uv's leisurely rise to recognition is its one sentence leading tagline, which the Astral team proclaim proudly on uv's Github page and on its website.

> "An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust."

The Astral team _should_ be proud, and it _is_ fast. _Really_ fast. But I don't think they're right to assume that people will care.

Sure, when your CI/CD pipeline drops from 5 minutes to 30 seconds and when your Docker builds shrink, speed actually matters. And this does have a compounding effect when it's used day-to-day.

But even then, speed isn't the main appeal of uv for me, and I suspect it's not the appeal of uv for most Python developers who use it, nor 'would-be' uv converts.

## The Real Problem uv Solves

The fundamental problem uv solves is tool sprawl. Python workflows used to be a Frankenstein's monster of different tools, each with their own configuration files and their own ways of breaking. uv isn't just a package manager â€” it's a _complete_ Python toolchain replacement:

- **Package management**: Replaces pip, pip-tools, pipenv
- **Virtual environments**: Replaces venv, virtualenv, conda
- **Project scaffolding**: Replaces cookiecutter for simple cases
- **Script running**: Replaces manual activation/deactivation
- **Building**: Replaces build, setuptools directly
- **Publishing**: Replaces twine
- **Python versioning**: Replaces pyenv

This means no more remembering which tool does what, everything lives in pyproject.toml, and _every_ commonly used command starts with uv.

When I onboard new developers now, I don't need to explain historical baggage. I don't need to walk them through installing 6 different tools and their various configuration files. I just say: "Install uv. Run 'uv sync'. Yep... LGTM."

uv is a unified tool that just happens to be blazingly fast. That's why it's winning (gradually), and that's why the marketing misses the mark. The future of Python tools is to only ever need one multi-tool.
